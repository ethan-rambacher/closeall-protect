# closeall-protect

To install the extension you must enable developer mode in Chrome.

Then go to chrome://extensions and "Load Unpacked Extension". Select the closeall-protect folder.

To select the proper keyboard shortcuts, click the hamburger menu icon at the top left and go to Keyboard Shortcuts (or go to chrome://extensions/shortcuts).

Scroll to CloseAll Protect. Under Trigger warning enter the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+W. Under Trigger Warning 2 enter Ctrl+Shift+Q.

This will activate the extension every time you accidentally press these shortcuts, and thus will prevent you from inadvertently closing all your Chrome tabs.
